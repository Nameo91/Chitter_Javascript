# Chitter
Chitter is a social media platform that allows users to create and share short messages, or "peep", with other users.

## Description
User story:
 * Users can sign up, sign in and sign out 
 * Users can post a message (or peep) when logged in
 * Users can see all peeps 
 * Users can see individual peeps
 * Users can delete peep which they posted 
 * Users can like and unlike peeps

The challenge is building a frontend that interacts with a backend API in javascript.
